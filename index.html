    <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">Nutrition is very important at every stage. Fresh food is cooked everyday for the students who are unable to bring tiffin from their home. Our canteen is certified by FDA. Dal-rice is the favourite food of all the students which is served hot in the recess time. The food quality and hygiene is regularly checked before it is served to the students. We also practice organic farming on a small scale so that we can regularly provide fresh agricultural vegetables. How and what a child eats today can have a huge impact on their adolescence and adulthood.</p>

 <h4>Implemented Online Attendance Management System</h4>

  Regular attendance is a key requisite for all students of St. Xavier's. A student should have a minimum of 75% of class day's attendance (Examination Board Rule) failing which the student may not receive promotion to the next level. In such cases, such students would have to repeat in the same class or be withdrawn.
  No pupil may absent himself/herself without obtaining leave previously, in writing. If for any reason, a student is absent without prior permission, on his/her return he/she must submit a letter from his/her parent/guardian, stating the reason for the absence and obtain permission from the principal or the vice principal before entering the class.</p>
</br>
2.Limit </br>
Students are allowed a maximum of 20 days of absence during an academic year. If a student takes more than 20 days leave, an absence fine of Rs. 20/- per day will have to be submitted to the class teacher (who will submit the details to the principal at the end of each month) and duly mention in the non-attendance record page of the diary at each occurrence. Any exceptional cases must be cleared by the principal or the vice principal.
Repeated absence without leave, or unexplained absence - if absent continuously without any information - for more than 10 working days, will be considered as the student's own decision to leave the school and such student's name will be struck off from the rolls
</br>
3. Refunds </br>
No refund of any sort like fees, etc. - will be given to those students who leave the school or who are dismissed or whose names have been deleted from the rolls.
A student who is sent away from school or whose name is struck off the rolls is, as a rule, will not be readmitted. If, due to any special consideration at the discretion of the principal, a student is readmitted, he/she will have to pay the readmission fee.
